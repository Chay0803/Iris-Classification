TASK 2-
Movie Recommendations :
Build a movie recommendation system
using collaborative filtering and machine
learning techniques in Python.
Recommender System is a system that seeks to predict or filter preferences according to the user’s choices. Recommender systems are utilized in a variety of areas including movies, music, news, books, research articles, search queries, social tags, and products in general. 



TASK 3-
Iris Classification :
Develop a ML Model for classifying iris
flowers based on their features using
Python, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow.
The Iris classification problem
Imagine you are a botanist seeking an automated way to categorize each Iris flower you find. Machine learning provides many algorithms to classify flowers statistically. For instance, a sophisticated machine learning program could classify flowers based on photographs. Our ambitions are more modest—we're going to classify Iris flowers based on the length and width measurements of their sepals and petals.

The Iris genus entails about 300 species, but our program will only classify the following three:

1)Iris setosa
2)Iris virginica
3)Iris versicolor
